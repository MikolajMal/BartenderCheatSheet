# BartenderCheatSheet üç∏

> A project built with ASP.NET Core, powered by the public [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) API. This app features search and ingredient-based filtering.

---

## üéØ Project Purpose

This app was created to:

- develop a functional MVP using public external APIs,
- demonstrate how to process and normalize non-ideal external data structures (e.g. `strIngredient1‚Äì15`),
- practice clean architecture patterns: DTOs, service layers, domain modeling, filtering logic,
- showcase engineering skills in handling real-world API limitations (like lack of multi-ingredient search),
- create a fun, visual project suitable for a portfolio without compromising on code quality.
